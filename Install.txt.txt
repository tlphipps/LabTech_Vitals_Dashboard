Installation:

Copy the contents from the downloaded zip file to a new directory called SWVDB in the webroot of the default web on your Labtech server.
	This should normally be C:\inetpub\wwwroot\SWVDB\ on most Windows IIS web servers.
	
Next You will need to download and install PHP on your windows IIS server. The easiest method is to download the PHP 5.3.27 installer
which will do all the work for you making it really easy to just go. But if you are the IIS guru and want to do a manual level install
of the latest and greatest then you will need to follow along with php.net	PHP.net says that for IIS servers using the Non Thread Safe 
versions of PHP are suggested and the MySQL plugin must be installed if the above installer is not used.

Now that we have PHP installed and hopefully working we need to modify the header.php file. We will be adding a LT user account that has 
basic access to reading the MySQL database. Open the Header.php file with notepad or any basic text editor and the first few rows with be 
the database user, password, server address and database name.  Change these to reflect your account information. Save the file and you 
should now be ready to go.


Browse http://your.LT.server.address/SWVDB/ and verify that the page displays

Now to integrate into your Labtech console, open the [Dashboard] -> [Config] -> ControlCenter Tab under System Options column 
find Initial URL text box and add the above URL there and save the config. This will cause this page to load in the console when you login.

The Squidworks Vitals Dashboard uses the data from the LT HitmanPro Plugin available at the LT market place. Download and install the plugin.

Then under the newly created hitmanpro group make sure you have systems in group and run the free scan to get data to populate.



Enjoy!
